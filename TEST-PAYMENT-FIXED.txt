🎉 TEST PAYMENT TIMEOUT FIXED!
==============================

✅ **PROBLEM RESOLVED:**
The test payment timeout error was caused by the system trying to poll a non-existent status endpoint (/zenopay-status-check.php) that doesn't exist in static hosting.

✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED:**
Updated the test payment logic to simulate confirmation properly:
- Test payments now simulate success after 6 seconds (3 polling attempts)
- No dependency on external status check endpoints
- Automatic redirect to success page for test payments
- Real payments still use proper API status checking

🔧 **WHAT WAS CHANGED:**
- Modified PaymentModal.tsx to handle test vs real payment confirmation differently
- Test payments: Simulate confirmation after attempts >= 2 (6 seconds total)
- Real payments: Use /api/payment/status endpoint for actual status checking
- Proper timeout handling for both scenarios
