🎉 PAYMENT ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED!
=====================================

✅ **PROBLEM FIXED:**
The "HTTP 403: Invalid API key" error was caused by the PHP proxy using a placeholder API key instead of the real ZenoPay API key.

✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED:**
Updated zenopay-proxy.php with the correct ZenoPay API key:
- OLD: 'your_zenopay_api_key_here' (placeholder)
- NEW: 'ArtYqYpjmi8UjbWqxhCe7SLqpSCbws-_7vjudTuGR91PT6pmWX85lapiuq7xpXsJ2BkPZ9gkxDEDotPgtjdV6g' (working key)
